# Facets Use Cases Repository

Welcome to the **Facets Use Cases** repository! This repository contains real-world examples demonstrating how to use **Facets** to simplify infrastructure provisioning and streamline software deployment across various use cases.

Each use case is structured as a separate folder, with subdirectories for:

- **Project Type** â€“ A reusable blueprint defining infrastructure and service logic.
- **Project** â€“ A complete implementation using that project type.



## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Facets allows you to easily import reusable infrastructure blueprints (Project Types) and complete application implementations (Projects) using Git. Follow the steps below to link and import these resources into your Facets Control Plane.
